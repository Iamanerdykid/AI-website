<!-- This website will explain what AI is and how someone can use it effectively.
 It will also explain how to use AI for school without just having AI write your 
 whole essay for you (basically how to use AI for school the correct way).-->

    <h1>Hello, Welcome to my Basic guide on AI. </h1> 
    <h2> Mission statement: </h2>
    <p> The term “AI” stands for artificial intelligence, which are computer systems that do things that usually require human intelligence, 
        such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.  Different AI’s have different purposes (things that they can do and are good at) for things that we want to do.  
        The biggest important thing to understand about AI is that it is a tool for humans, not a sentient being like you and me.  
        While it may be able to do things that humans can do, they don’t have intelligence like humans do.
        The difference between AI’s are what they can do vs can’t do.  You may have heard about Chatgpt, which is the first major ai to be developed.  
        Chatgpt can do lots of things that are very helpful to humans.  
        Some of these are: answering questions, write/edit essay’s, summarize information, help with coding (java, python, c-script, e.c.t), do math, stay updated with current events, and a lot more minor stuff.  
        But there is a lot of stuff it can’t (or wont) do, like make videos, analyze pictures.  That is where the many other ai bots out there serve their purposes.
        The one thing that ai won’t do is anything that could be illegal.  
        For example, asking chatgpt how to build a bomb or find someones address won’t work, and will be tracked.  
        Chatgpt will say this message “I’m designed to follow strict safety and ethical guidelines, which means I won’t provide instructions or information related to illegal activities,
        including things like how to build a bomb, hack systems, commit fraud, or harm others.”
