<!-- This website will explain what AI is and how someone can use it effectively.
 It will also explain how to use AI for school without just having AI write your 
 whole essay for you (basically how to use AI for school the correct way).-->

    <h1>Hello, Welcome to my Basic guide on AI. </h1> 
    <h2> Mission statement: </h2>
    <p> One of the more recent things AI has effected is social media.  
        Around 2-3 weeks ago, AI got good enough at video-making to start making videos that look almost perfect to reality.  
        The definition of social media is “social media is enabling users to create profiles, share content (text, images, videos, etc.), and interact with others through various features like comments, likes, and direct messaging.  
        A big part of social media is making money and getting famous through uploading videos/posts.  
        What AI could do is make fake videos for money, which is very unfair to people who are trying to make money by working hard on their own videos.  
        AI can also do the same things with pictures.
        While making fake videos is annoying, it isn’t directly harming anyone.  
        But something that me and a lot of people and very concerned about is deepfake ai.  
        Essentially, deepfake ai allows people to “create convincing forgeries by training algorithms on vast amounts of data”.  
        There are a lot of different kinds of this, but some a lot worse than others.  
        They can be used to create real humans and have them do whatever you want, which is very disturbing.  
        Knowing people, most of the time people will be sensible and use it to create cool, interesting videos.  
        But there are some people out there who will use it for their own desires, which may have moral consequences/will be harmful to other people.
        There have also been whole channels that are just AI.  
        For example, a popular music band called “The velvet sundown” with almost 1 million monthly listeners on spotify (spotify is a popular music site for creators to post their music/albums) was caught for generating most of their lyrics using AI.  
        And because of just how easy it is to generate lyrics there are probably many other artists that do this and just haven’t gotten caught yet.
