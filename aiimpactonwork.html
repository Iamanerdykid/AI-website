<!-- This website will explain what AI is and how someone can use it effectively.
 It will also explain how to use AI for school without just having AI write your 
 whole essay for you (basically how to use AI for school the correct way).-->

    <h1>Hello, Welcome to my Basic guide on AI. </h1> 
    <h2> Mission statement: </h2>
    <p> Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the way we live and work, bringing major changes to industries across the world.  
        From chatbots to automated factories and data analysis tools, AI technologies are revolutionizing processes and increasing efficiency. 
        As businesses adopt these tools to stay competitive, the field of work is changing, and both opportunities and challenges are emerging for workers in nearly every section.
        One of the most significant benefits of AI in the workplace is increased productivity. AI can handle repetitive tasks with speed and accuracy, freeing up human workers to focus on more creative or strategic responsibilities. 
        In healthcare, for instance, AI helps doctors analyze medical images more quickly and accurately. 
        In finance, AI-powered systems can detect fraud in real-time. 
        Moreover, AI can enable the creation of entirely new job roles—such as AI trainers, data ethicists, and machine learning engineers—opening doors for innovation and new career paths.												
        Despite these advantages, the rise of AI also presents serious concerns. 
        Automation can lead to less jobs, particularly in industries that rely heavily on routine manual or clerical tasks. 
        Workers without access to retraining or education may struggle to adapt to new demands, increasing inequality in the workforce. 
        Additionally, the reliance on AI can lead to ethical issues, such as biased algorithms or a lack of accountability in decision-making. 
        These challenges highlight the need for thoughtful policies and workforce support to ensure that the benefits of AI are shared fairly and responsibly.  
        (note: this was partially created using AI) </p>
