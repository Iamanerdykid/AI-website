<!-- This website will explain what AI is and how someone can use it effectively.
 It will also explain how to use AI for school without just having AI write your 
 whole essay for you (basically how to use AI for school the correct way).-->

    <h1>Hello, Welcome to my Basic guide on AI. </h1> 
    <h2> Mission statement: </h2>
    <p> Since AI has become a thing, it has been used in all sorts of things.  
        One of the biggest things it has had an impact on is school.  
        As a student who currently goes to school, ai is used for a lot of different things, for which most are pretty unethical.  
        Somethings teachers may use AI to create instructions for a project, help with grading, planning out their schedules, e.c.t.  
        But it becomes VERY controversial when students use AI.
        AI is a very powerful tool.  
        It can do a lot of the things you can do/have to do in school, like writing essays and doing math.  Now put yourself in a students shoes.  
        Imagine you had to write a 10 page essay on something you weren’t interested in in a week.  
        You could either spend several hours working hard on that essay and maybe do well, or ask chatgpt to write the same essay and it would write a better essay in like 5 minutes.  
        That is why so many students nowadays use ai for school.  
        But because ai can write an essay in 5 minutes, it is unfair and banned from schools. 
        But that doesn’t stop kids from using it, because of just how much time you can save by doing it.
        The way to counter students using ai is something called an ai/plagiarism detector.  
        The way these detect ai is by looking for the specific writing style that ai uses and highlighting it.  
        But students have a way to counter that, which is a form or ai called a humanizer.  What these do is look for ai in a text, and turn it into different words to make it look normal.  
        Coming to an ethical side of things, the main reason school is a thing is for kids to learn things.  
        But when kids use ai to do everything for them, they aren't learning anything.  The only ethical way for kids to use ai is to brainstorm on a project or help on something they are stuck on.
